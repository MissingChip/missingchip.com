            <h2>Projects!</h2>
            <p>
            Here's a few of my projects, and other things I've worked on.<br>
            If I think something's good enough to put on here, I'll add it.<br><br>
            </p>
            <h3><a href="/about">This Website</a></h3>
            <p>
                - a page I use to have a custom icon/page title in TST,
                which can serve as a group header.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="title">Tree Style Tab Group Header</a></h3>
            <p>
                - a page I use to have a custom icon/page title in TST,
                which can serve as a group header.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="https://github.com/ParticleGrid/ParticleGrid">ParticleGrid</a></h3>
            <p>
                - a project to facilitate deep learning on molecules.
                I've developed most of the data generation code.
                I used several HPC techniques to generate voxel datasets on the fly for machine learning,
                and learned a lot about compilers, multithreading, simd, and a bit of CUDA.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="conversion">Hex-Binary Conversion Game</a></h3>
            <p>
                - a little JavaScript game to practice hex-binary conversions. Can do arbitrary bases too.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="https://github.com/MissingChip/warp-draw">Warp-Draw</a></h3>
            <p>
                - Used Rust and JS to make a webpage and WebSocket protocol that draws whatever polygons you send it.
                It's rather simple, but it taught me quite a bit about Rust and the web.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="https://github.com/MissingChip/Miano">Miano</a></h3>
            <p>
                - an early C++ project of mine, which let you use your keyboard as a piano, with a terminal UI.
                I also made it generate psuedo-random, nice sounding (at least, I think so) piano music.
                Learned about C++, ncurses, music theory, audio, audio processing, audio formats.
            </p>

            <h2>Exploration</h2>
            <p>The following are all projects I cannot demo/show for one reason or another, often I just was doing something quickly to learn about a new thing.<br><br></p>
            <h3>EVIL</h3>
            <p>
                - "Ethan's Vulkan Interface Library", a project I made in C primarily to learn about Vulkan and how Graphics works. The intention is to have a convenient, layered vulkan interface mostly to help me understand the API itself.
            </p>
            <h3>Thread Pool</h3>
            <p>
                - A thread pool, written in C++. Learned about C++ and multithreading.
            </p>
            <h3>Blinkenlights</h3>
            <p>
                - I've used atmel attiny's and rp2040's to make gifts for people, and learned a lot about embedded programming.
            </p>
            <h3>Controll Keys</h3>
            <p>
                A C project using XCB to take controller inputs and turn them into keyboard presses and mouse movements in a more convenient way than I've seen done before.
            </p>
            <h3>Rust Empire Generation</h3>
            <p>
                - There's a game I really enjoy called Empire Builder. I wrote a program which could automatically generate hex maps for the game given real-world city populations and locations I found on the internet.
            </p>
            <h3>Reverse Engineering</h3>
            <p>
                - I've done reverse engineering a few times, but there was an especially memorable project I did in one of my computer architectures class.
                It was a classic "Bomb Defusing" reverse engineering project.
                I decided to reverse engineer further than we were required to for the class, and got the most points possible because I found it fun.
                We didn't get extra credit or anything for doing that, and I was actually the only one who did it anyways.
                Learned a lot about assembly (particularly x86-64) and also used Ghidra some.
            </p>
            <h3>CTFs</h3>
            <p>
                - I've done a few CTF challenges with various focuses over time, but I've yet to actually do a writeup on any. I should do that sometime. I've definitely learned a lot about computers and security doing those.
