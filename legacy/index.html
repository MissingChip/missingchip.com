            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I'm a Software Engineer at Jahnel Group. I studied CS and Cybersecurity at Binghamton University.
            I have work published at ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) and APS (American Physical Society) conferences.
            I have a love for exploration and discovery that thrives in both the information-rich world of technology and the great outdoors. 
            I currently develop full-stack applications with Jahnel Group, tackling the hardest problems they have to throw at me.
            I worked as an intern with Grammatech developing software for static security analysis. 
            I have worked with Sonnet Software developing and maintaining their MATLAB interface. 
            <br><br>
            I've done research with professors Kenneth Chiu and Hoda Naghibijouybari at Binghamton University,
            devloping remote microarchitectural side channel attacks using the WebGPU framework with Professor Naghibijouybari
            and building the ParticleGrid project for novel drug generation with Professor Chiu.
            Through exploring different focuses in college I've found any technical challenge interests me.
            <br><br>
            I have risen through the ranks of scouting all the way to the highest rank of Eagle, 
            and along the way learned valuable lessons about leadership and project management. 
            Exploration has also driven creative projects, such as art and photography.
