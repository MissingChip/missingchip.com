                <h2>About missingchip.com</h2>
                <p>
                This website is hosted on a Raspberry Pi in my Binghamton dorm room. At least, it was until I moved this site to GitHub pages.
                It ran Raspbian Lite as an Apache web server. All the HTML and CSS is made by me, from scratch. 
                I purchased the domain through hover, and their DNS server pointed via a CNAME record to a dynamic DNS solution provided by No-IP. 
                All of the resources for the website are <a href="https://github.com/MissingChip/MissingChip.github.io">on GitHub</a>. 
                I made this website to experiment with networking and web design, and because I wanted a website to showcase my work. 
                Is that the most efficient and easy way to have a personal website? Absolutely not. That's why it's on GitHub now.
                It is, however, fun and educational.
