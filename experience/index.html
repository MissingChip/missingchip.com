            <h2>Experience/Qualifications</h2>
            <p>
            I have experience with many various types of software, including programming languages such as C, Python, Java, etc. 
                (see r&eacutesum&eacute) 
            and a robust understanding of the hardware that allows them to function. 
            Through Science Olympiad I have gained experience in fields such as electrical engineering, 
            optics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetics, as well as other general physics topics. 
            I know calculus through multivariable calculus and have a strong base in linear algebra. 
            Below is a summary of some of my work experience.
