                <h2>Scouting</h2>
                <p>
                I have been a scout since 5th grade.
                Over the years I rose through the ranks, went to scout camp, even visiting high adventure camps like 
                <a href="#philmont">Philmont</a> and <a href="#seabase">Sea Base</a>. 
                Finally, I reached the rank of Eagle.
                </p>

                <h2>Eagle Project</h2>
                <p>
                The Eagle Project is the final step before eagle.
                In it, a scout must plan and execute a service project of their own design.
                For my project, we built  eighteen 8’ x 4’ raised beds at my local church, Good Shepherd Lutheran Church.
                It took us two days to get everything done and was a useful leadership experience.

                <h2>Philmont</h2>
                <p>
                Philmont is a scouting ranch in the Rocky Mountains of North of New Mexico.
                There, my scout troop went on an approximately 100-mile 12-day trek from campsite to campsite.
                Below is a collage of pictures of what is known as "The Tooth of Time",
                one pair of images taken each day the first time the Tooth could be seen, the final being the surveying marker at the top.
                Below is a panorama of the view from the top.

                <h2>Sea Base</h2>
                <p>
                Sea Base is a scouting high adventure camp with bases in Florida and the Bahamas.
                My troop went to the latter. On this trip, we spent a week sailing in the Sea of Abaco.
                It was a great experience which taught a lot about working as a team, 
                but was also just a great time and allowed me to get closer with members of my troop.
