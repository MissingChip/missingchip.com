            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            Iâ€™m a Senior at Binghamton University studying computer science. 
            I have a love for exploration and discovery which thrives in both the information-rich world of the internet and the great outdoors. 
            I worked as an intern with Grammatech developing software for static security analysis. 
            I have worked with Sonnet Software developing and maintaining their MATLAB interface. 
            <br><br>
            I've done research with professors Kenneth Chiu and Hoda Naghibijouybari at Binghamton University,
            building the ParticleGrid project with Professor Chiu and 
            researching potential hardware-based vulnerabilities with the WebGPU framework with Professor Naghibijouybari.
            Through exploring different focuses in college I've found almost everything interests me.
            <br><br>
            I interned with Syracuse University, doing web scraping and interpreting data from social media sites. 
            I have risen through the ranks of scouting all the way to the highest rank of Eagle, 
            and along the way learned valuable lessons about leadership and project management. 
            Exploration has also driven creative projects, such as art and photography.
